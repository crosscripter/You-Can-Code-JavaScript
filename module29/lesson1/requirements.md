# Project TODOs

**Project** #8675309     **Assigned**: Bob (NY)

**Department** IT/Engineering/Development

**Due Date**: *ASAP* (delayed from: *yesterday*)

**Requirements Meeting**: TBD (pending: requirements planning meeting)

<sub>Any questions should be directed to the project manager: donotreply@bigcompany.com</sub>


## Functional Requirements

### Add Todo:
- Users can enter a todo item in an input field.
- A button labeled "Add Todo" will trigger the addition of the todo. **(Pending marketing on verbiage)**
- Each todo should have a unique ID.

### View Todos:
- Todos will be displayed in a list format.
- Each todo item should display the text and have a checkbox to mark it as complete.

### Mark as Complete:
- Users can mark a todo as complete by checking the checkbox.
- Completed todos will have a visual indicator (e.g., strikethrough text).
**(pending UI/UX designer on line color)**

### Delete Todo:
- Users can delete a todo item using a delete button next to each todo. ~~items should be *archived* on Amazon S3~~
- Upon deletion, the todo should be removed from the list.

### Persist Data:
- Todos will be stored in local storage to retain the list across page reloads. **(database/backend under development for Q4)**
- Data will be serialized to JSON format for storage and deserialized upon retrieval. **(question: YAML?)**?

### Component Structure:
- Use of functional components with hooks for state management. **(see dev style guide, somewhere on the intranet)**
- A custom hook to handle local storage interactions.
- A Higher Order Component (HOC) to wrap the main todo component for added functionality, such as logging.

### Styling:
- Styled Components will be used to create a responsive and appealing UI. **(until in-house UI library is completed)**
- Each component should have its own styles encapsulated.

### Testing:
- Each component should have corresponding unit tests to ensure functionality. **(question: cut testing for timeline?)**
- Integration tests *should* verify the interaction between components. 

## Non-Functional Requirements:
- The application should have a user-friendly interface. (big text with lots of emojis üòÅ)
- It should load quickly and be responsive across different ALL screen sizes on ALL devices on ALL platforms ALL the time **(should be easy just different sizes of screens, no?)**. 
- Code should follow best practices for readability and maintainability. *(NOTE: this will all go out the door once the project deadline gets cut short)*
